Original work by Chuck Hanavin and David Mills at the University of Delaware 1992

Original project here:
https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/gadget.html

files are floating around on various archives, the board files themselves are only viewable as Postscript files which modern windows does not understand.
new pdf files for the pcb are avalible after converting using ps2pdf on linux (ubuntu)
modern components could be used to get the footprint smaller, however without a decent antenna to receive the NRC brodcasts
this project will be a paperweight (albeit a very cool piece of internet history)
